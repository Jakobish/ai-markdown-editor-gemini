## üöÄ Motivation

Writing is often a process of constant refinement. Whether you're drafting technical documentation, creating blog posts, or taking notes, the ability to quickly iterate on your text is essential. This project was born from the idea of merging a clean, efficient Markdown writing environment with the advanced capabilities of modern AI.

The goal is to create a seamless workflow where you can:
-   Draft your content without distractions.
-   Instantly summon an AI to fix grammar, summarize text, change the tone, or even translate.
-   Apply AI-suggested changes with a single click, directly in the context of your document.
-   Eliminate the need to copy-paste between your editor and a separate AI chat window.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To run the AI Markdown Editor locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-markdown-editor.git
    cd ai-markdown-editor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your AI provider:**
    -   This project uses the Google Gemini API. You'll need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your API key to the `.env` file:
        ```env
        API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
        ```
    > **Note**: The application is designed to source the API key from this environment variable. It is not stored in local storage or exposed on the client-side bundle.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & To-Do
